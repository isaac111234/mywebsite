             <h1> Brief History</h1>
            <p> Nelson Sunday created the African tech-entrepreneurship program called Power-365 to help entrepreneurs realize the possibilities that come with their businesses and ideas, and to provide solutions to some of the most obvious problems facing humanity today.</p>

            <p>  We believe that only those who have once been at the forefront of similar challenges through their rich vein of experience would know how best to tackle such challenges and their possible consequences in ways that would be generally beneficial.</p>

                  <li> The Power-365 Entrepreneurial Show is an audio-visual program that provides seed funding for entrepreneurs.</li>
                  <li>  Entrepreneurship has helped nations tackle economic problems. The success of startups and SMEs will go a long way towards achieving economic stability on a national scale.</li>
                  <li>  This is why we have developed a program that is aimed at resolving the financial crisis faced by entrepreneurs today.</li>
                  <li> Starting a business can be very difficult, especially when you begin with a loan. Even loans can be quite difficult for new companies and entrepreneurs to access, and there is the ever-present pressure on you to succeed or else forfeit your valued collateral.</li>
                  <p> The object here is to provide you with non-refundable capital for your business or idea.</p>
